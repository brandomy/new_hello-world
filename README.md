# new_hello-world
This is my 2024 first run.

It has been some time since I first logged into Github - and so I need to refresh my memory.

## Where I come from

I was born in Canada - where I lived through my schooling, through university, and through my first, brief career in the Navy. 
After marrying Olya and her obtaining citizenship we moved to Shanghai, where we lived for 21 years.
We lived short of 3 years in Russia, then moved to Canada where we lived for 2 and a half years.

## Where I am going to

Now we have come Penang, Malaysia.
We hope to work out a way to be here for a few years - before I would like to head back to Russia.
